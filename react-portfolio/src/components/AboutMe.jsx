    <img src="src/assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" alt="Kyle Marcak" />
    <p>Born and raised in Texas, I had a passion about space travel as a kid. My father was a software developer for Compaq at the time. Later it would be known as HP. This had a profound effect on me as I wanted to become an engineer as well, just like my dad. </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>Once I saw the Iron Man Movie in 2008 I wanted to specifically be a mechanical engineer. This was a dream of mine until I encountered Thermodynamics. I had to make a choice half way through my collegiate career to either stay in engineering or to switch. I chose the later, and switched to Finance at the suggestion of my grandpa, as I was able to retain alot of enjoyable skills that transfered over into the field. </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>I am now currently enrolled in this software development bootcamp for the sake of one day being able to utilize these skills for either my future career endeavors, or when I start my own businesses. I will have working knowledge of web development.</p>
